# LimeCMS
An elementary (so far) PHP content management system.

LimeCMS was made in an effort to learn the basics of PHP, and advance my HTML(5) and CSS(5) knowledge. It is still an elementary CMS which covers the basic functions, such as add, delete and edit articles and users, and some functionality for categories. Further, it features static templates for the creation of a dynamic website with MySQL backup.

Despite development has halted for the time being, here follows a list of several features that are nice to have:
- Change to PSR-4 autoloading with composer (to enchance collaboration).
- Complete face off with help from Bootstrap or Pure CSS.
- Add gallery with images and videos.
